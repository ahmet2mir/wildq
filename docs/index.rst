Wildq User Documentation
==============================

Purpose of this package is to provide a simple wrapper arround jq for different formats. I'm tired of searching a package doing yaml jq, toml jq, ini jq etc. mainly used for scripting.


The latest stable version `is available on PyPI <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/wildq/>`_.
